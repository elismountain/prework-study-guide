## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

This study guide is built for someone who has a goal to enter a career in tech and become a front web developer. 
I have build this project to help students to organize themself, and provide them with some structure and support to make the learning process easier. 

During the time I have spent working on this project I have learned some basics of JS, HTML and CSS, I installed all the reqiiered tools I need for boot camp, sorted out how to use Git and deployed a website.
